        <h1>My Life Story</h1>
        
        <h2>Early Childhood</h2>
        <img src="your-image-url.jpg" alt="Childhood Memory">
        <p>The only thing I remember from my early childhood was the aftermath of Bagyong Yolanda hitting our country. When we returned, we found our belongings and the floor all muddy. I was very young then and didn’t fully understand the situation. However, I vividly remember playing with my cousins on a pile of dirt. We jumped on it, making it look like a liquid. That's one of my earliest memories before I entered kindergarten.</p>
        
        <h2>Kindergarten and Elementary School</h2>

        <p>During kindergarten, I was a typical student, although I struggled with reading and writing. As I moved on to elementary school, I wasn’t an average student. I was often labeled as "dumb" because I couldn’t read or spell well. Additionally, I had a large head and was bullied for it. They called me “bulan,” and I cried a lot because of the bullying. I never told my parents about it. In grade 5, however, a teacher encouraged me to practice reading and spelling. Over the years in elementary school, I gradually improved and was finally able to read and spell correctly. Looking back, I wish someone had helped me earlier because it was really difficult.</p>
        
        <h2>High School</h2>

        <p>In high school, I was an average student. I wasn’t failing, nor was I excelling. I just had a normal high school life. The bullying stopped since those who used to bully me were no longer in my new school. I made a few friends, but it was enough for me. When I reached grade 11, I heard that good grades were essential for college. This motivated me to work hard in grade 12, and I managed to become one of the classroom achievers. That’s how my high school life went by.</p>
        
        <h2>College</h2>

        <p>When it came to college, I had no other choice but to choose Lorma. The university I initially wanted was fully booked for the course I preferred. Despite this, I don’t regret my decision. At Lorma, I experienced betrayal and joy, made friends who share the same vibe as me, and felt comfortable being my true self. I still keep in touch with my online friends whom I’ve met along the way.</p>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Now, I'm writing this narrative because I need to submit it to get a good grade. Reflecting on my journey from childhood to college, I realize how far I've come and how much I've grown.</p>
